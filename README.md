# K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
The project was based on the classification of data using the k-nearest neighbor method, without the use of the "scikit-learn" library, which contains a ready-made implementation of the algorithm. The classification was carried out on a database containing congressional voting results from 1984 from the University of California's UCI database.
